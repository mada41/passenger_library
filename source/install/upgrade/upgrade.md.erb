<h1>Upgrading <%= edition_title %> <%= integration_mode_name_as_passenger_suffix %></h1>

<p class="lead">How to upgrade <%= edition_title %> <%= integration_mode_name_as_passenger_suffix %> depends on how <%= edition_title %> was installed. Please select the option most relevant to you.</p>

**Table of contents**

<ul class="toc-container"><li>Loading...</li></ul>

<% if integration_mode_type == :standalone %>
  <div class="note">Are you using Ruby, and do you have "passenger" or "passenger-enterprise-server" in your Gemfile? Then take a look at the <a href="#gemfile">Gemfile upgrade instructions</a>.</div>
<% end %>

<h2 id="osx">Mac OS X (Homebrew)</h2>
<div>
  <p>If <%= edition_title %> was installed on OS X through Homebrew, then you can upgrade <%= edition_title %> as follows:</p>

  <% if integration_mode_type == :apache %>
    <pre class="highlight">brew update
brew upgrade <%= formula_name %></pre>
    <p>When done, read the Homebrew formula caveats and follow any Apache-specific instructions you see:</p>

    <pre class="highlight">brew info <%= formula_name %></pre>
  <% elsif integration_mode_type == :nginx %>
    <pre class="highlight">brew upgrade <%= formula_name %> <%= nginx_formula %></pre>

    <p>If Passenger has been updated, but no new Nginx version has been released, then you must also reinstall Nginx against the latest version of Passenger:</p>

    <pre class="highlight">brew reinstall <%= nginx_formula %></pre>
  <% else %>
    <pre class="highlight">brew upgrade <%= formula_name %></pre>
  <% end %>
</div>

<h2 id="debian_ubuntu">Debian packages (Debian, Ubuntu)</h2>

If <%= edition_title %> was installed through the Phusion Passenger [APT repository](<%= url_for "/install/#{integration_mode_type}/apt_repo/index.html" %>), then you can upgrade <%= edition_title %>
<% if integration_mode_type != :standalone -%>
  along with <%= integration_mode_name %>
<% end -%>
through APT using the following command:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade

<h3 class="notoc">Don't see any updates?</h3>

If you don't see any updates, then there are two possible reasons:

 1. Our Debian packages haven't been released yet. When we release a new version of <%= edition_title %>, it typically takes 1-2 hours for our server to build Debian packages.
 2. If you are using a non-Long Term Support version of Ubuntu, then it is possible that we have [dropped support for that Ubuntu version](<%= url_for "/install/#{integration_mode_type}/apt_repo/index.html" %>#limited-package-support-for-non-lts-ubuntu-versions).

<h2 id="redhat_centos">RPM packages (Red Hat, CentOS)</h2>

If <%= edition_title %> was installed through the Phusion Passenger [YUM repository](<%= url_for "/install/#{integration_mode_type}/yum_repo/index.html" %>), then you can upgrade <%= edition_title %>
<% if integration_mode_type != :standalone -%>
  along with <%= integration_mode_name %>
<% end -%>
through YUM using the following command:

    sudo yum update

<h3 class="notoc">Don't see any updates?</h3>

If you don't see any updates, then maybe our RPM packages haven't been released yet. When we release a new version of <%= edition_title %>, it typically takes 2-3 hours for our server to build RPM packages.

<h2 id="heroku">Heroku</h2>

If you are using <%= edition_title %> on Heroku, then update the `<%= gem_name %>` gem by running:

    bundle update <%= gem_name %>

Then commit and push to Heroku:

    git commit -a -m "Upgrade <%= edition_title %> to latest version"
    git push heroku master

<h2 id="docker">Docker</h2>

Please refer to [the passenger-docker website](https://github.com/phusion/passenger-docker#upgrading_passenger) for upgrade instructions.

<h2 id="source_tarball">Source tarball</h2>

If <%= edition_title %> was installed through a source tarball, then please follow the [source tarball upgrade guide](tarball_upgrade.html).

<% if integration_mode_type == :standalone %>
  <!-- ****** Ruby gemfile ****** -->
  <h2 id="gemfile">Ruby Gemfile</h2>

  <div class="note">Are you using Heroku? Please read the <a href="#heroku">Heroku upgrade instructions instead.</a></div>

  <p>If you are using <%= edition_title %> Standalone, and at the same time you have "<%= gem_name %>" as an entry in your Gemfile, then you can upgrade <%= edition_title %> by running:</p>

  <pre class="highlight">bundle update <%= gem_name %></pre>
<% end %>

<h2 id="rubygems">RubyGems<%= " (but not through Gemfile)" if integration_mode_type == :standalone %></h2>

<% if integration_mode_type == :standalone -%>
If Passenger was installed through RubyGems (but not through [Gemfile](#gemfile)),
<% else -%>
If Passenger was installed through RubyGems,
<% end -%>
then upgrading Passenger involves going through the normal installation process again. Please follow the installation guide that is most relevant to you:

 * [Installation guide with RVM](<%= url_for "/install/#{integration_mode_type}/install/#{edition_type}/rubygems_rvm/index.html" %>)
 * [Installation guide without RVM](<%= url_for "/install/#{integration_mode_type}/install/#{edition_type}/rubygems_norvm/index.html" %>)

Please *ignore the warning* there that tells you that the guide is not for updates.

<% if integration_mode_type == :apache %>
  When done, please don't forget to update the Apache configuration snippet that the installer tells you about at the end.
<% elsif integration_mode_type == :nginx %>
  Be sure to install Nginx into the same prefix that you previously installed Nginx to.

  When done, please don't forget to update the Nginx configuration snippet that the installer tells you about at the end.
<% end %>
